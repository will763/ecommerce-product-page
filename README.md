# ecommerce-product-page 👨‍💻

This was a project to develop an ecommerce product page with features, such as a cart where the products purchased by the
customer are saved, this feature was made using redux to save the current state of the
cart. Another cool feature is responsiveness, in which the page adapts to the user's screen size.
it was the first time I used redux instead of React's Context api. 😄

### The challenge 👀 ⬇️

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
